Clientele is about helping you get the most out of your relationships with customers, clients, suppliers, associates or any other type of contact. 

== Description ==

Clientele is a simple Client Relationship Management plugin for WordPress and you are about to be one of the first people ever to download it.
Clientele will help you get the most out of your relationships with customers, clients, suppliers, associates or any other type of contact. 
If you're running a business, a website, a community organisation, if you are freelancing or involved in any type of group, you want to know as much as you can about the people you interact with.
nKeeping track of all your contact details, interactions and communication can quickly become unmanageable and not surprisingly when we use a number of different applications, tools and approaches for formal and informal communication in business and social settings.
Clientele is simple enough to be accessible and beneficial to the average WordPress user, including small business and individuals with no prior experience using client management systems.
Clientele has a modular structure. This means there are no complicated features you don't need. When you are ready, Clientele is ready to expand with you and help you make the most from your client data.
Your data is valuable so don't give it away. One of the key benefits of Clientele is that your data is stored on your server and is never given to a third party.
Clientele allows you to configure and use every piece of information you want to know about your clients.
Once you have added a few clients you will have a powerful address book and database of contact information. This by itself is a very useful reference tool. However there is an opportunity to start marking the most of your client data with add-on toÂ complete various business tasks or capture client information from your website.
