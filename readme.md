Simple Client Management for WordPress

Traditionally Client Relationship Management has been the complicated domain of large business. Clientele aims to change that with a simple product that allows anyone to get started and quickly realise benefits.

Think of Clientele like a high powered, configurable address book. You tell Clientele what information is important for your business and start collecting the data.

Whilst Clientele is great for storing and retreving client information, you can do much more with Add-ons. Add-ons can enhance Clientele and connect with your data allowing you to complete business activities.

Clientele is brand new so initially we are releasing a limited number of modules. Currently we are working on:
  - Email Marketing
  - Forms
  - Utilities
